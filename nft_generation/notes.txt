The "layers" folder is where you put the elements that you use for the generation
The LayersEmpty folder replicates the structure of the layers folder
Donttouchlayers is the folder where all the layers are in the their original format

You choose your layers, and then run ''' node index.js''' and then the results are spat out in the build folder
